                We met almost two years ago in a small town Valkeakoski in southern Finland. One evening we both decided
                to
                go to a party were we both didn't really feel like going to. It also happened that most of our friends
                cancelled
                going.
                Being friends of friends, we met at that party and decided to stick together. One month later after many
                late
                night conversations
                we had our first date. Since that day we hadn't spent a day apart.
                <p></p>
                Since Bart had to go back to the Netherlands in May, Polina decided to do a minor there and go with him.
                We
                moved in
                together to a student house in Eindhoven. In autumn 2017 we went to Paris on holidays. After a day
                of exploring the city, Bart asked Polina if she wanted to go to Pont Alexandre III. That is the place
                where Bart
                went down
                on his knee and asked if Polina wanted to be his wife. Polina gladly answered yes!
                <p></p>
                As a young couple, little did we know how much work it is to arrange a wedding. Somewhat more than a
                year later
                we managed to
                prepare everything. Now we are ready to have a beautiful March wedding.

                    <div>We have decided to go for a small wedding with the closest family members and
                        friends. The event will
                        be held in the beginning of March, 2019 in Wasvenboerderij, Eindhoven, The Netherlands.
                        <p></p>
                        The Wasvenboerderij, an organic farm in the north-east of Eindhoven was chosen, as
                        we had found
                        the area and the atmosphere there beautiful and, additionally, a natural and ecological aspect
                        of living
                        is important for us.
                        <p></p>
                        We hope you understand our decision to have a small wedding and the fact that due to that we
                        cannot
                        invite all of our friends. We have sent several personal invitations and the response button
                        below is for
                        those who got them.
